                        <p>For essentials in Art and Music, we explored five different narratives in the creation of art.
                            Therefore, we had to do two essays to demonstrate our understanding of the narratives and debate
                            the work presented in the lectures. For the final assignment, we had to write a sixes narrative
                            and a discipline in art and music.</p>

                            <strong>Abstract</strong><br/>
                            Media Technology, today we take for granted that media technology has become a significant
                            impact on our lives. We use it as a method or a tool to create, produce and compose new media.
                            As well to support human communication over distances in time and space. The medium ranges
                            from common media types like photography, video, information and interactive media. However,
                            why could these new technologies be seen as a base for the movement of Modernism? First,
                            let us categorize these media technologies in four different groups by historical value:
                            Art media, print media, electronic media and digital media.
                        </p>
