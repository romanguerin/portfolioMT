                        <p>This course presented principles, methods, and organization of scientific research.
                            Furthermore, it aimed to consolidate and extend prior views on academic research that varying
                            educational backgrounds may have. We had to do a home class assignment, and we had to write a
                            7 papers essay where we had to write a paper on 7 papers within a subject. My subject was the influence
                            of chatbots as new technology. </p>

                            There is a growing interest in the research of chatbots, also known as artificial agents, and their use as
                            social support for humans, especially in the field of addressing people in stressful situations or health
                            improvements. However, not much research is available in the use of chatbots in the context of everyday
                            social interaction to address social isolation and loneliness. Examples include providing a safe space
                            in which people can discuss anything without fear of judgment or retaliation by giving them positive
                            messages, and providing helpful advice when other sources or communication are not available.
