                            At the end of my bachelor Communication & Multi Media Design, I started to get
                            in touch with the use Artificial Intelligence, and I knew this was a direction I wanted to go
                            into. Even though my internship offered me a job, I felt that doing a Master would be a future
                            I wanted to explore.
