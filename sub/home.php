                        <h3>About me</h3>
                        <p>I'm a creative technologist, therefore I like to combine technology and design to
                            create an immersive experience.
                            Previously, I did a Bachelor<a style ="color: black" href="https://www.avans.nl/studeren/opleidingen/communication--multimedia-design/voltijd"> Communication & Multimedia Design </a>
                            and my internship in Paris at <a style ="color: black" href="https://ac3-studio.com/">AC3 Studio.</a>

                        <h3>Media Technology</h3>
                        <p>
                            At the end of my bachelor Communication & Multi-Media Design, I started to get in touch with
                            the use of Artificial Intelligence, and I knew this was a direction I wanted to learn more about.
                            Even though my internship offered me a job, I hoped that doing a Master's would explore this field,
                            and Media Technology helped me connect my previous knowledge with an academic standpoint. So,
                            to finish my master's, I wrote a thesis on design principles for social robots to reduce unwanted
                            AI bias in human-robot interaction.
