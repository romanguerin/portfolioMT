                        <br/>
                        <p>In this seminar-style course, we studied the topic of artificial intelligence and took a broad
                            and historical view. Other students mainly held the presentations, and some were given by the lecturer.
                            The goal of the course was to learn, study, process and present scientific material, and learn about
                            the history and broader context of artificial intelligence.

                        <h3>Seminar</h3>
                        <p>
                            The seminar consists of lectures, multiple homework tests, and student presentations.
                            The seminars existed on whether machines can think, evolutionary computation, neural networks,
                            computing with DNA, computers and emotions, computational creativity and more. In addition,
                            we had to give our own seminar on Rodney a Brooks about intelligence without representation as an assignment.
