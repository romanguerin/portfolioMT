                            <strong>Abstract</strong><br/>
                            In the summer of 2019, the White House held a summit on artificial intelligence (A.I.) and
                            its use in the government. This conference highlighted the innovative efforts
                            at Federal agencies and looked into the future for transformative A.I. applications. A couple
                            of months later, the Federal Government of the United States launched AI.gov, a public website
                            to access all governmental A.I. initiatives, information and data that are currently underway.
                            This essay will focus on the launch of AI.gov as a way to see if Artificial intelligence
                            can help government agencies in the public-sector.
                            And to see if this initiative is an approach to gain the public trust in the government by
                            being transparent.
