                        <p>The creation of a piece of art implies the choice of the medium; in this course, Meta Media,
                            we learned to integrate this choice into the artistic process. The theme of this one week course was:
                            Memes. We, as a theme, took it a bit further and understood memes as a way to change the commen
                            perception of a medium. Thus deepfake seemed a good medium to explore this theme.
                            Therefore we came up with a company and made a website that had an ‘algorithm’ to detect deepfakes called Fairify.

                        <p>In a modern-day digital society, technology can make it look as if anyone has said or done anything.
                            The upsurge of deep fakes is an enormous prospective problem for truth as we know it. With Fairify Inc.,
                            we bring autonomous knowledge verification back to the public. Using a new approach to deconstruct and
                            analyze deep fakes, our free-to-use program predicts the evolution of upcoming deep fakes. This way,
                            it does not only correctly determine the authenticity of 99.2% of current videos, but keeps this
                            record for newer deep fakes generated after the release of our project. With Fairify Inc., the
                            trust that truth deserves can be restored.</p>
