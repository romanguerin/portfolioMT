                        <p>With Human Computer Interaction, we learned about man-machine interfaces. In particular, the
                            case for systems that require interaction is an essential ingredient for its normal operation
                            with computers and computer programs. With this course, MediaTech students and Computer science
                            students worked together to make an HCI assignment. We chose to work on BioFeedback and computer
                            interfaces as a new meaning to perceive Art.

                            Temperature is something that is always present, you can constantly feel it.
                            However, in most cases, it is rarely used as a way to convey information. The
                            addition of temperature as a way of displaying or conveying something is a
                            relatively unexplored area. We took the opportunity to work on this new interaction,
                            and we have shown that images can be expressed through the sensation of
                            temperature and can be used as an additional way to experience art. A creative
                            approach using the so-called Peltier elements helped us realise this work.
