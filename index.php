                            <p><i>Vivid means producing powerful feelings or strong, clear images in the mind, memorable,
                                    and profound in you. For any of us when we have very vivid memories of being in a place we have
                                    them because something about the place stays with us and because we were once more, in whatever way,
                                    immersed in that world.</i>

                                <p>This is now the core sentences of where my research is. But that came out after what
                                    AC3-STUDIO asked of me for my graduation study:
                                <strong>How can the technology of today help us to reinvent the virtual experience of tomorrow?</strong>
                                </p>
                            <br/>
                                <p>Well let’s take out the two most important words to better understand the meaning of this question.
                                    <strong>Virtual </strong> and <strong>Experience.</strong>
                                </p>
                                    <br/>
                                <strong>Virtual</strong>
                            <p>
                                <i>Something that is virtual can be done or seen using a computer and therefore without going anywhere or talking to anyone.</i>
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>You can trace virtual or virtual reality back to the hype of the virtual reality headset, something that has been
                                a hype for some time but this isn’t really the case anymore. <a href="header/refs.php">Enconsultancy, Wired, Forbes</a>
                            <br/><br/>
                            It doesn’t really work because there is an important human factor element in VR. The fact is, if we do not get
                                the human element correct, then no amount of technology will make VR anything more than an interesting tool.
                                Even when VR principles are fully understood, the first implementation is rarely novel and almost never ideal due to the complex
                                nature of VR and the countless possibilities that can be created. <a href="header/refs.php">Jason Jerald. PH.D.</a>
                            <br/><br/>
                                We have to accept human perception and behavior the way it is, not the way logic tells us it should be.
                                Engineering will always be essential as it is the core of VR systems that everything else builds upon,
                                but VR itself presents a fascinating interplay of technology and psychology, and we must understand both to do VR well.

                                Virtual reality is defined to be a computer-generated digital environment that can be experienced and interacted with as if that environment were real.
                                <i><strong>“The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter.

                                        With appropriate programming such a display could literally be the Wonderland into which Alice walked.”

                                Technically minded people tend to dislike the word “experience” as it is less logical and more subjective in nature.
                                But when asked about their favorite tool or game they often convey emotion as they discuss how, for example, the tool responds.
                                They talk about how it makes them feel often without them consciously realizing they are speaking in the language of emotion.
                                Emotion and cognition are tightly coupled, with cognition more often than not justifying decisions that were actually made emotionally.
                                VR must be experiences with both emotion and logic.

                                Immersive is the third word which is related to the question. Because it’s a good adjective
                                that combines the two previous words (Virtual & Experience) and is where I believe the core of the question lies.

                                An immersive world is a place in which anyone can get wrapped up. Whatever your background in life,

                                An immersive world will take you in such that you won't want to leave.
